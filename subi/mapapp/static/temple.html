                    Murugan temples are Hindu temples dedicated to the god Murugan, also known as Kartikeya or Skanda. They are found across Tamil Nadu, India, and in various parts of the world where there are significant communities of Tamil Hindus. These temples are significant for their architecture, particularly in the Dravidian style, and are often located on hills or in scenic areas.
